- Challenge: Try to figure out a way to display only the
- first line of note.body as the note summary in the
- sidebar.
-
- Hint 1: note.body has "invisible" newline characters
- in the text every time there's a new line shown. E.g.
- the text in Note 1 is:
- "# Note summary\n\nBeginning of the note"
-
- Hint 2: See if you can split the string into an array
- using the "\n" newline character as the divider
